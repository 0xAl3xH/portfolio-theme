### Portfolio theme

This is a theme named "alex" that will be used for my personal [website](alexhuang.me) primarily aimed to document my project/work and life.

A better name for the theme may be chosen later.

The theme follows the Ghost convention of file structure. The only thing that is different is that the CSS is generated using LESS so there is a folder, appropriately named `LESS` for the corresponding source files. 

The compilation for LESS and minification of subsequent CSS files is handled by a package that I modified which uses Grunt to automate the process. Similarly, Javascript library is also handled by this tool which leverages Bower to make injecting dependencies a breeze. I will create of repo for this library in due time.
